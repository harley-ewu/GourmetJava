## Installation

To run the UML Editor you need to have the most recent Java Virtual Machine installed(JVM). After having JVM installed you can use different techniques to run the program which are using an IDE, a terminal, or Gradle to run the program. 

This Installation guide will walk you through the process of installing a JVM and Gradle an open-source build automation tool.

### Java Installation

**For Windows**

1. Open up your browser of choice. 
2. Go to Oracle's [website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) to download the most recent version of Java for Windows.

4. Go to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-20\bin or wherever your bin file is located for Java. Copy the path of your bin file.
5. Open up Window's Start and go to Edit the System Enviroment Variables.
6. Select Environment Variables &rarr; navigate the System variables window and look for Path and double-click it &rarr; click new &rarr; and then paste the bin path into the the new line &rarr; click okay out of all windows to apply changes.
7. Open a command prompt.
8. In the console enter `java --version` to check that JVM was properly installed.

**For Linux**

1. Open a terminal.
2. Enter `sudo apt install openjdk-19-jre-headless`. Enter `ls` to see if the rpm file is present.
3. In the terminal enter `java --version` to check that JVM was properly installed.
